# OpenRouter MCP Server Lessons Learned

## Implementation Insights

1. API Integration
   - Issue: OpenAI SDK models.list() lacked OpenRouter-specific data
   - Solution: Implemented direct OpenRouter /models endpoint integration
   - Learning: Use API-specific endpoints for accurate data

2. Rate Limiting
   - Issue: API requests could fail during high usage
   - Solution: Implemented header-based rate tracking with exponential backoff
   - Learning: Always implement proper rate limiting for API stability

3. Error Handling
   - Issue: Generic error responses weren't helpful
   - Solution: Added structured error handling with specific messages
   - Learning: Provide detailed error context for better debugging

4. Model Management
   - Issue: Model capabilities weren't properly tracked
   - Solution: Added comprehensive model interface with capability tracking
   - Learning: Design interfaces to capture all API-specific features

5. State Management
   - Issue: Cache invalidation wasn't properly handled
   - Solution: Implemented timed cache with validation
   - Learning: Always include cache invalidation strategy

## Common Pitfalls

1. Rate Limits
   - Pitfall: Not handling rate limits properly
   - Solution: Implemented header tracking and automatic waiting
   - Prevention: Monitor and respect API rate limits

2. API Response Types
   - Pitfall: Incorrect assumptions about response structure
   - Solution: Created comprehensive type interfaces
   - Prevention: Validate API responses against documentation

3. Cache Management
   - Pitfall: Stale data causing inconsistencies
   - Solution: Added cache expiration and validation
   - Prevention: Implement proper cache lifecycle

4. Error Recovery
   - Pitfall: Failed requests not properly retried
   - Solution: Added exponential backoff strategy
   - Prevention: Always implement retry logic for API calls

5. Model Capabilities
   - Pitfall: Not checking model-specific features
   - Solution: Added capability validation
   - Prevention: Track and verify model capabilities
