# OpenRouter MCP Server Context

## Project Overview
This MCP server was created to provide a unified interface for accessing various AI models through OpenRouter.ai. The implementation focuses on simplicity and reliability while maintaining extensibility for future features.

## Key Decisions
1. Used OpenAI SDK for OpenRouter integration
   - Reasoning: OpenRouter follows OpenAI's API format
   - Benefit: Type safety and built-in error handling

2. Implemented single chat_completion tool initially
   - Reasoning: Most common use case
   - Future: Can expand to support other endpoints

3. Headers configuration in OpenAI client
   - Reasoning: Consistent headers across all requests
   - Implementation: Set in constructor via defaultHeaders

## User Interactions
- Successfully tested with meta-llama/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct:free
- Updated model examples to reflect current OpenRouter offerings
- Changed license from MIT to Apache 2.0

## Future Considerations
1. Potential features to implement:
   - Stream support for real-time responses
   - Model validation before requests
   - Rate limit handling improvements

2. Areas for optimization:
   - Error message formatting
   - Response type safety
   - Request validation
