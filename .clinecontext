# OpenRouter MCP Server Context

## Project Overview
This MCP server provides a unified interface for accessing various AI models through OpenRouter.ai. The implementation focuses on simplicity and reliability while maintaining extensibility for future features.

## Key Decisions
1. Used OpenAI SDK for OpenRouter integration
   - Reasoning: OpenRouter follows OpenAI's API format
   - Benefit: Type safety and built-in error handling

2. Implemented model management tools
   - list_models: View all available models
   - search_models: Find specific models
   - set_default_model: Configure default model
   - clear_default_model: Reset default model
   - get_model_info: Get model details
   - validate_model: Verify model validity

3. State Management Implementation
   - Used singleton pattern for consistent state
   - Implemented model caching for performance
   - Added model validation before operations
   - Included clear methods for cleanup

4. Headers configuration in OpenAI client
   - Reasoning: Consistent headers across all requests
   - Implementation: Set in constructor via defaultHeaders

## User Interactions
- Successfully tested with various models including:
  - anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229
  - anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229
  - cohere/command-r-08-2024
- Updated model examples to reflect current OpenRouter offerings
- Added model validation and information retrieval

## Current Status
1. Implemented Features:
   - Chat completion with optional default model
   - Model listing with accurate pricing and context length
   - Model search with capability filtering
   - State management with timed caching
   - Detailed model information retrieval
   - Rate limiting with exponential backoff
   - Model capability validation
   - Robust error handling

2. Areas for Improvement:
   - Add streaming support for real-time responses
   - Implement token counting for cost estimation
   - Add batch request support
   - Enhance model capability validation

## Future Considerations
1. Potential features to implement:
   - Streaming API support
   - Cost estimation and budgeting
   - Batch processing for multiple requests
   - Enhanced model capability detection

2. Areas for optimization:
   - Response streaming efficiency
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Rate limit optimization
   - Request batching performance
