# OpenRouter MCP Server Lessons Learned

## Implementation Insights

1. Package Configuration
   - Issue: Missing essential npm package configuration sections
   - Solution: Added bin, files, repository sections and other required fields
   - Learning: Always include complete package.json configuration for proper npm deployment

2. API Integration
   - Issue: OpenAI SDK models.list() lacked OpenRouter-specific data
   - Solution: Implemented direct OpenRouter /models endpoint integration
   - Learning: Use API-specific endpoints for accurate data

3. Rate Limiting
   - Issue: API requests could fail during high usage
   - Solution: Implemented header-based rate tracking with exponential backoff
   - Learning: Always implement proper rate limiting for API stability

4. Error Handling
   - Issue: Generic error responses weren't helpful
   - Solution: Added structured error handling with specific messages
   - Learning: Provide detailed error context for better debugging

5. Model Management
   - Issue: Model capabilities weren't properly tracked
   - Solution: Added comprehensive model interface with capability tracking
   - Learning: Design interfaces to capture all API-specific features

## Common Pitfalls

1. NPM Package Configuration
   - Pitfall: Incomplete package.json configuration
   - Solution: Added all required sections for npm deployment
   - Prevention: Reference complete package.json templates

2. Rate Limits
   - Pitfall: Not handling rate limits properly
   - Solution: Implemented header tracking and automatic waiting
   - Prevention: Monitor and respect API rate limits

3. API Response Types
   - Pitfall: Incorrect assumptions about response structure
   - Solution: Created comprehensive type interfaces
   - Prevention: Validate API responses against documentation

4. Cache Management
   - Pitfall: Stale data causing inconsistencies
   - Solution: Added cache expiration and validation
   - Prevention: Implement proper cache lifecycle

5. Error Recovery
   - Pitfall: Failed requests not properly retried
   - Solution: Added exponential backoff strategy
   - Prevention: Always implement retry logic for API calls

## Best Practices Identified

1. Package Configuration
   - Include complete metadata (repository, bugs, homepage)
   - Configure binary for CLI installation
   - Specify required Node.js version
   - List published files explicitly
   - Add prepublishOnly script for build safety

2. API Integration
   - Use API-specific endpoints for accurate data
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Handle retries with exponential backoff
   - Validate responses against types

3. Error Management
   - Provide detailed error context
   - Implement proper retry strategies
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Return structured error responses

4. State Management
   - Use singleton pattern for consistency
   - Implement proper cache invalidation
   - Validate state changes
   - Track resource usage

5. Performance
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement efficient retry strategies
   - Use proper typing for runtime checks
   - Optimize API request patterns
